# MapReduce Simulator

This is a MapReduce simulator used in my PhD at Universiti Technology PETRONAS, Malaysia. 

The goals of the simulator is to simulate low-level work of MapReduce especially the scheduling part. Thus, we can easily design and prerun our scheduling algorithm in this platform before implementing it in the real MapReduce system.
